# Warp
A browser for WAP.

## History
In contrast to the song by Cardi B song, WAP is an obsolete protocol used in mobile phones. Pages were served using WML, which rather than just one document like HTML, it used cards, each of which represent a single interaction with the user.

# Reason
Because I can! Also I believe that it's important to be able to view older technologies on current hardware. That's even more important now that several countries are shutting down 2G networks and with them the ability to browse WAP sites from older feature phones that had support for the protocol. 
Hopefully, this tool can be used to test and demo WAP sites.
For domains that serve WAP, as fas as I know, only Frogfind.
