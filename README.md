# Warp Drive

This is the main engine of the Warp browser. It's a parser for the WAP Markup Language, it converts the markup into a memory representation out of objects that one day will power a WAP browser, converting the whole page into a tree that can be traversed and changed like HTML. 

### Purpose

This package allows you to parse any WML file into a tree out of objects. This allows you to read information for each node, edit something on the go and in the future support interactivity via WMLscript.


### Installation

Run the command:
`pip install git+https://github.com/SaulNunez/warp.git`
